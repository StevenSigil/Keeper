# Keeper
A "to-do" type application, made with react.

Keep is an application that allows you to creat and delete *To Do* notes in the browser.  Built with React and using minimal styling while exploring [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) libraries.  

It is one of the first React applications that I successfully completed.  In it's current state, it is not set up to use a database, however it very easily could if desired.

You can view the completed application at the following link: https://keeper-to-do.herokuapp.com/
